# DNA Sequence Analyzer

## Overview
This project analyzes Fasta files containing DNA sequences to identify and separate genetic regions (promoters) from non-genetic regions. It provides valuable insights for genomic research by pinpointing key regulatory elements in DNA sequences.

## Key Features
- Promoter Identification: Detects promoter regions in DNA sequences
- Sequence Segmentation: Separates genetic from non-genetic regions
- Fasta File Support: Works with standard Fasta format files
- Analysis Tools: Provides metrics and visualization options for DNA sequence analysis
